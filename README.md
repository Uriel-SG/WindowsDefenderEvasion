# Windows Defender Evasion
**An easy way to evade WD!**

WORK-IN-PROGRESS

History:
Back in 2020, as a "poor" 5cr1pt k1dd13 in love with the Hacking-World, I was desperately looking for a way to create malware that evaded antivirus.
 
All the ways shown on youtube or described in any site dedicated to hacking were ***totally unsuccessful***. 
The antivirus in fact was constantly able to block the malware as soon as the file or the file were copied on the laptop.
So... 

The only way was: **I have to do it**.

But the question was: *"How? I'm not a programmer!!"*
A voice inside me answered: *"Hey dude! Use the poor knowledge that you have, combining it with...**social engineering**!"*
Well done! This is the result:

And... ***It worked!***


NOW in 2022 I'm trying to create a program that automate all the process, creating the malicious file ready to be used.

Hey, this is ONLY for **Educational Purpose**.
